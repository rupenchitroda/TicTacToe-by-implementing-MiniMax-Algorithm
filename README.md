## Description 
A Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses) game with the implementation of MiniMax AI Algorithm in which user/player will never be able to win against the machine/ai user.

## A bit more about MiniMax Algorithm
Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally.

In Minimax the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.
